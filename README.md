The following steps were implemented to ensure data accuracy and completeness for analysis purposes:

A standardized date format was established across all entries.

Null values were filled in specified columns to ensure the consistency and reliability of data.

Addresses were separated into individual columns to enhance data legibility.

Duplicate entries were removed to ensure data uniqueness and accuracy.

Irrelevant columns were eliminated from the dataset to simplify analysis.

Through this data cleaning process, valuable knowledge and experience were gained in managing real-world data. Consequently, a well-organized and cleaned dataset was obtained, ready for further analysis and exploration.
